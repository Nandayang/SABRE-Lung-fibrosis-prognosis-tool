# ü´Å SABRE: Smart Airway Biomarker Recognition Engine

This is the official repository for the "**Prognostication in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis using quantitative airway analysis from HRCT**‚Äù. SABRE is the **first interpretable, fully automated** airway volume quantification tool tailored for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).  
It provides robust prognostic markers, improves early progression detection, and generalizes across fibrosing ILDs.

## ‚ö° Study Highlights

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Independent Prognostic Markers**  
SABRE-derived airway volume metrics showed significant, independent associations with mortality when adjusted for:  
- FVC%  
- DLCO%  
- Semi-quantitative radiology scores  
- Existing AI methods  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Early Progression Detection**  
Incorporating SABRE metrics into predictive models rendered traditional lung-function markers non-significant,  
capturing **early 12-month progression** with superior sensitivity.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Risk Stratification**  
- High-risk group (top SPAV quartile) ‚Üí **71.1% 12-month progression event capture**  
- ~9% improvement over the Composite Physiologic Index (CPI)  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **High Generalization Ability**  
Validated not only in **IPF cohorts**, but also in **other progressive fibrosing ILDs** (UILD, CTD-ILD, CHP).
